# reactApp
My first React App
- I will be using a video from [Bro Code](https://youtu.be/CgkZ7MvWUAA?si=Yic7iTuw3WhlweMo) to learn react and build on the entire app along the way.

## Outline
  - I want the final product to be an app that I can potentially use as a website for content creation and blogging. I want a site that has links to all of my social media and a blog page for documenting my journey from little IT expierence to IT professional.
